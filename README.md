l + tab = komandas  
man l = komandas ( list directory contents)  
Pwd = path of the current working memory  
Cd = change directory  
Cd.. = move one directory up  
Cd- = move to previous  
Ls = view contents of directory  
Ls -R = list all the files in the sub-category as well  
Ls -a = will show the hidden files  
cat = list tge contents of a file on the standart output.  
cp = copy files from current directory to a different directory.  
mkdir = make a new directory.  
rmdir = delete empty directories.
rm = delete directory and contents within (no undo).  
touch = create new blank file.  
locate -i school*note = search for a file case insensitive.

Each variable in C has an associated data type.  
  
The integer data type in C is used to store the whole numbers without decimal values. Octal values, hexadecimal values, and decimal values can be stored in int data type in C. We can determine the size of the int data type by using the sizeof operator in C. Unsigned int data type in C is used to store the data values from zero to positive numbers but it can’t store negative values like signed int. Unsigned int is larger in size than signed int and it uses “%u” as a format specifier in C programming language. Below is the programming implementation of the int data type in C.  
   
Integer Format Specifier: %d  
  
Character data type allows its variable to store only a single character. The storage size of the character is 1. It is the most basic data type in C. It stores a single character and requires a single byte of memory in almost all compilers.  
  
Format Specifier: %c  
  
In C programming float data type is used to store floating-point values. Float in C is used to store decimal and exponential values. It is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point values) with single precision.  
  
Format Specifier: %f  
  
A Double data type in C is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point values) with double precision. It is used to define numeric values which hold numbers with decimal values in C. Double data type is basically a precision sort of data type that is capable of holding 64 bits of decimal numbers or floating points. Since double has more precision as compared to that float then it is much more obvious that it occupies twice the memory as occupied by the floating-point type. It can easily accommodate about 16 to 17 digits after or before a decimal point.  
  
Format Specifier: %lf  
  
  
      Derived data type : These data types are defined by user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. These include Arrays, Structures, Class, Union, Enumeration, Pointers etc.  
      
        
        Pointers are used for storing address of variables.  
 
 Array is used to contain similar type of data.  
 	structure is used to group items of possibly different types into a single type.

  \n - pārceļ kursoru jaunajā rindā  
  \t - pārceļ kursoru uz tuvāko tabulācija pozīciju  
  \v - vertikālais tabs  
  \b - pārceļ kursoru par vienu pozīciju atpakaļ  
  
A function is a C language construct that associates a compound statement (the function body) with an identifier (the function name). Every C program begins execution from the main function, which either terminates, or invokes other, user-defined or library functions.
